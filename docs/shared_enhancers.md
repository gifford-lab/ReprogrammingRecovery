## Mouse shared enhancer sequences

We developed a set of universal mouse enhancers to use as negative control sequences for motif enrichment, which are available as a [bedfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gifford-lab/ReprogrammingRecovery/main/data/mm10_shared_enhancers.txt) and [fasta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gifford-lab/ReprogrammingRecovery/main/data/mm10_shared_enhancers.fa)
