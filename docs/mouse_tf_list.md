## Mouse Transcription Factor List

To evaluate RNA-seq based methods, we developed a [list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gifford-lab/ReprogrammingRecovery/main/data/mouse_ensemble_tfs_from_lambertetal_isyes.unique.txt) of 1,374 mouse transcription factors based on the curated list of human transcription factors from [Lambert et. al, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29425488/), where a list of 2,765 proteins were manually curated to those which are likely to have DNA-binding domains and exhibit sequence-specific binding.
